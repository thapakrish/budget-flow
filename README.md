# budget-flow

Welcome to budget-flow!

The structure of document is based on ProjectTemplate, which is an `R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects`. 

To load the project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the parent directory, then:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

For more details about ProjectTemplate, see http://projecttemplate.net
